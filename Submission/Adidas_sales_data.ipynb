    "## 4.1. Overall Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the top-performing product categories, geographical areas, and retailers is essential for making strategic decisions and projecting demand. Since the demand for a specific product category is often steady, demand forecasting using the static technique can be employed to estimate future demand based on historical patterns. \n",
    "\n",
    "These techniques stand out for being straightforward and dependent only on historical data, ignoring outside variables that could affect variations in demand. The only information available for forecasting is historical data. When slight demand fluctuations, static approaches may be sufficient to capture regular patterns, obviating the need for more complicated models. Static techniques are helpful when prioritizing short-term planning. They provide quick insights into current demand estimates and don't require a thorough analysis. \n",
